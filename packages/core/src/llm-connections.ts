 * scheme allowlist gate.
 *
 * The renderer can submit any string for `CreateConnectionInput.baseUrl`
 * / `UpdateConnectionInput.baseUrl`; the AI SDK fetch downstream
 * normally rejects non-HTTP schemes, but the IPC boundary should
 * not depend on that. A successful persist of a bogus baseUrl
 * (`javascript:`, `file:///etc/passwd`, garbage) means the bad URL
 * lives on disk and could later be loaded into an HTTP client
 * configured to honor it (or worse, leak the user's API key to an
 * attacker-controlled scheme handler).
 *
 * This is a credentials-exfiltration boundary, not a usability gate
 * — we intentionally do NOT block private-network / localhost URLs
 * (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM and other local providers need
 * `http://localhost:11434`, `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, etc. to work).
 * Provider/setupMode-specific further restrictions are a separate
 * future PR.
 *
 * **Pair with `normalizeConnectionBaseUrl` for the IPC site.**
 * This function only validates; it does NOT trim or canonicalize.
 * The IPC handler should use `normalizeConnectionBaseUrl` so the
 * store only ever sees the canonical form (trimmed URL or
 * undefined) — not raw whitespace-padded input. See @kenji msg
 * 8755ffb3.
 *
 * Accepts:
 *   - `undefined` / empty string / whitespace-only: no override,
 *     fall back to provider default. Returns `null` (valid). The
 *     caller treats this as "user wants the provider's canonical
 *     baseUrl".
 *   - `http:` / `https:` schemes parsing as valid `URL` (case-
 *     insensitive scheme via WHATWG URL spec).
 *
 * Rejects (returns error message):
 *   - Any other scheme (`file:`, `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`,
 *     `chrome-extension:`, `app:`, `maka:`, custom).
 *   - Malformed URL strings the `URL` constructor throws on.
 *   - Pathological lengths (> 2048 chars — defense against
 *     adversarial inputs; real-world baseUrls are < 100 chars).
 *
 * Returns `null` on accept, an error string on reject. Mirrors
 * `validateSlug`'s shape.

 *     padded raw string.
 *
 * Caller contract:
 *
 * The caller calls this helper ONLY when it has a string value
 * (the IPC handler already decides whether `baseUrl` is in the

 * Return shape:
 *   - `{ ok: false, error }` — bad scheme / malformed / oversize.
 *   - `{ ok: true, value: '<trimmed URL>' }` — accepted override.
 *     Caller sets the store payload's `baseUrl` to this value.
 *   - `{ ok: true, value: '' }` — EXPLICIT CLEAR INTENT (user
 *     typed whitespace meaning "remove my override"). Caller must
 *     preserve this as `''` so the store's existing clear semantics
 *     (`patch.baseUrl !== undefined ? patch.baseUrl || undefined :
 *     current.baseUrl`) treat it as "clear existing override". DO
 *     NOT convert to `undefined` — that would be "don't touch" and
 *     silently swallow the user's clear intent.
 *
 * The trim is the only canonicalization performed. We deliberately
 * do NOT change scheme/host case, strip default ports, drop
 * fragments, etc. — that's a different normalization (URL
 * canonicalization) and could surprise users who deliberately
 * configured `https://Example.com:443/V1`. Trim is the minimum
 * needed to prevent whitespace from becoming a stored override.
