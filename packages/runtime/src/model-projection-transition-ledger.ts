/**
 * The Session-scoped reducer over durable model-projection transitions (#4283).
 *
 * One authority, one direction: the append-only operational AgentRunEvent
 * ledger holds the transitions, this module folds them onto the canonical
 * RuntimeEvent stream, and every consumer of model-facing history — the live
 * continuation, the next Turn, a cold restart, rolling compaction, a branch —
 * reads the result of that fold rather than the raw events.
 *
 * Two rules make the fold deterministic regardless of who wrote what when:
 *
 * 1. Source-digest validation. A transition may only replace the exact
 *    projection it names. A writer that decided against a projection some other
 *    writer has already replaced is stale, and its record is inert forever —
 *    not applied later, not applied on another machine, not applied after a
 *    restart. This is what stops replaced content from coming back.
 * 2. Predecessor chaining. Within one target, a transition applies only when
 *    the transition it names as predecessor is the one currently in effect. The
 *    chain is also the fold's ordering authority: successors are followed, never
 *    sorted, so ledger order, arrival order, run order and clock skew cannot
 *    disagree about the result.
