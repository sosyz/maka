/**
 * What one scroll through the transcript COSTS, asserted as counts.
 *
 * The suite this replaces asserted wall-clock frame timings, and a timing
 * assertion on a shared runner either flakes or gets switched off — that one
 * was switched off behind an env var nothing ever set, so it never ran at all
 * and every regression it existed to catch shipped. These assertions are
 * structural: a number that does not move between runs on the same code, and
 * does move when the thing it guards regresses. They run in ordinary CI.
 *
 * Gestures are RELATIVE input — a real wheel through CDP, which is also what
 * the product's own history paging listens for. The replaced suite drove
 * scrolling by writing absolute `scrollTop` values per frame, which erases the
 * scroll-anchoring correction the browser applied since the previous frame, so
 * the probe fought the scroller and produced displacement that looked like a
 * product bug.
