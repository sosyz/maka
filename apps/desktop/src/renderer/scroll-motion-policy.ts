/**
 * Scroll motion policy helper (PR109f).
 *
 * Centralizes the rule for whether a `scrollIntoView` / scroll-driven
 * animation should collapse to `auto` (no animation) vs. `smooth`.
 * Extracted so the rule can be unit-tested without a DOM.
 *
 * Three triggers collapse motion:
 *   1. `data-maka-reduced-motion="true"` on the document root — set by
 *      the PR-IR-04 reduced variant of the e2e-fixture fixture.
 *   2. `data-maka-e2e-fixture="true"` on the document root — set by
 *      ANY e2e-fixture capture (@xuan PR109f confirmed e2e-fixture
 *      always writes this attribute; the reduced-motion attr is only
 *      set on the reduced variant). This is the broader signal for
 *      "deterministic capture, no animations".
 *   3. OS-level `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` user preference.
 *
 * The helper accepts the inputs as plain values so the caller decides
 * how to extract them (DOM in app code, fixtures in tests).
