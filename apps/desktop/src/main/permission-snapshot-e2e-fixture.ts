/**
 * #1361: a typed OS-permission snapshot for the `settings-permissions` e2e
 * fixture, which the alignment audit renders.
 *
 * The page is worth auditing for what happens when a row carries several grant
 * buttons: the row grid's `auto` actions track used to beat the body's
 * `minmax(0, 1fr)` and squeeze it to 0px, hiding which permission the row was
 * even about. Reading the host's real TCC state cannot produce that — a
 * fully-granted dev machine renders no buttons at all, and Linux CI reports
 * most permissions as `unsupported`, so the audit would measure an empty page.
 *
 * This fixture pins the states that matter instead:
 *   - `screen_recording` — `not_determined` + requestable + openable, the
 *     three-action shape (open, guided drag, request) that exercises the squeeze;
 *   - `accessibility` / `notifications` — `granted`, no buttons;
 *   - `automation` — `unsupported`, which carries the widest status Badge
 *     ("当前平台不支持", ~101px intrinsic and `whitespace-nowrap` by primitive
 *     contract) and so sets the row's minimum readable width.
 *
 * Mirrors the Storybook fixture in `stories/settings/settings-pages.stories.tsx`,
 * which is where the row's layout contract is asserted, so the audited page and
 * the story baseline describe the same states.
 *
 * Production is untouched: this returns null unless the fixture scenario is
 * active, and `registerPermissionsIpc` falls back to `buildPermissionSnapshot`.
